## About The Project

Lost in Translation is a web application made by Pavel Ibrahim as the second assignment in the advanced Noroff Accelerate program at Noroff. The web application is able to translate english letters to sign language! Users and translations history will be stored in a api and updated based on activity from the user. The web application is developed with Reactjs. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To install React we need npm and Node.js, this can be done through here: [Download npm and Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

Lastly we need to install the React Libraries that were used in this project. These were installed through the command line.

`npm install react`
`npm install react-router-dom`
`npm install react-hook-form`
`npm install react-scripts`
`npm install react-dom`
